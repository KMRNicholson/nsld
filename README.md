# Never Skip Leg Day Mobile
Mobile application for my Never Skip Leg Day web app which can be found here at https://neverskiplegday.ca. The user interface and experience will be revamped from the old version currently available online.

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to create an app that gives the user the capability to create their own specialized workout programs, as well as track the progress of their workouts. On top of the workout tracking feature, the app also has meal tracking as part of the nutritition feature, as well as personal records tracking as part of the records feature.

Finally, this is a personal project that will help my own understanding of mobile development. I chose Xamarin.Forms as I am comfortable using C# as a development language, as well as my familiarity with the .NET Standard library.

## Features
The features included in this app are workouts, nutrition, and records. The app will be available to all, however there will be an option to sign in. If the user signs in, they will have access to more features such as the records feature, as well as account settings. There may be more functionality to each specific feature for signed in users created in the future.

To make logging in and signing up easier for the user, I plan to implement social media log in and sign up on top of the manual sign up by email and password.
